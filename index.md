## Introduction

Welcome to Cantor! This first project will get you started on your programming journey. 
For those of you who already have some programming experience, feel free to skim through this tutorial 
to brush up on any development concepts.

### Some Notes

Before we get started, here are some notes about how Cantor projects are structured:

- Our projects are process-oriented. In some of our projects, specifications will lead you towards a “sub-optimal” approach. Typically, these are geared towards teaching an important concept that will enhance your understanding of the underlying ideas behind fundamental programming concepts. In some cases, they teach strategies that will help you become a more effective coder as you undertake more complex projects, but may seem redundant now. In any case, feel free to reach out to your mentors to ask questions, but focus on the journey, not the destination.

- Throughout the project specifications, you’ll find links like this one. Click the links! Even if you have an understanding of the concepts being described, these links will typically help you get a more thorough understanding of the subject matter (any may provide a hint on the next step of the project).

- Some steps may seem ambiguous. This is intentional. We encourage you to think critically and use all the tools in your toolbox to problem-solve. So don’t be afraid to use google, stack overflow, etc to explore solutions. We will typically link documentation to any technology you are using in the project specification.

- Don’t use ChatGPT to generate code. When working on large projects, it is a tool that can help you be a more efficient and effective programmer.  Used as a starting point for further research, it can be a valuable learning resource. But for the scope of the smaller projects we write, asking it to write code can only stunt your learning and hinder your progress later on. And anyway, it’s unreliable. You’ll find better code through a Google search anyway.

### Overview

Let’s get started.

A simple ________ in Python.

In this tutorial we will:

- Introduce the command line
- Set up an IDE (Interactive Development Environment)
- Download the necessary dependencies to
- Use version control to store code changes
- Build a simple command line PROGRAM


### Learning Goals
- [] Command Line
- [] Interacting with the development environment
- [] Version control using git
- [] Basic Python (control flow, iteration, etc.)


## Command Line Tools

Let's install some command line tools and get to know the command line. Linux users will have these tools by default.

### macOS Setup

### Windows Setup
https://eecs280staff.github.io/tutorials/setup_wsl.html


### Command Line

Now that we’ve set all of that up, let’s learn about the CLI (Command Line Interface)

## Dev Environment

Next, let’s set up our development environment (most Cantor members use VS Code, however you are free to choose whichever you prefer).

- [VS Code (recommended)] (https://eecs280staff.github.io/tutorials/setup_vscode.html)
- [XCode] (https://eecs280staff.github.io/tutorials/setup_xcode.html)
- [Visual Studio] (https://eecs280staff.github.io/tutorials/setup_visualstudio.html)
